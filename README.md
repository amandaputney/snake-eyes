## Elevator Pitch
Do you feel lucky? _Well, do ya punk?_ If so, continue reading... 

The goal of this 2 player dice game is to get the most points.
There are 5 rounds of the game:

1- **S** \
2- **N** \
3- **A** \
4- **K** \
5- **E** 

**RULES:** For each turn, the current player rolls the dice. If they get any combination that doesn't include a 'snake eye' (a single pip on the die i.e. a die face with a value of one) they count their current points, and have the option to keep rolling or end their turn. If their roll includes a single snake eye, they don't get any points for that turn. If their roll includes double snake eyes, they lose all accumulated points. 
The player with the most points on the 5th round wins.
